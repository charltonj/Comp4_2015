        <h1>This is Assignment #1 for Computer Programing 4!</h1>

        <h3>Loyola High School now has a SmugMug Account to store all of its photos.</h3>

		<p>I've been taking photos and adding them to albums that can be found on the <a href="http://loyolahighschool.smugmug.com">SmugMug Page</a>.</p>

		<p>The website is built by myself off the SmugMug platform. The Loyola News decided on using it because of its flexablity, reliablity, and customizabilty.</p>

		<p>Users begin by choosing a theme for their site and then customizing it to their liking. Throughout this customization process, users begin to utilize powerful tools that allow photos to be organized and stored in whichever way they want. This also allows them to display these photos however they want because of the aforementioned customization tools.</p>

		<p>Below are some examples:</p>

		<table>

			<th colspan="5">On the site users can find the following photo albums:</th>

			<tr>

				<th>The 2014 Academic Award Winners</th>

				<th>The Dominican Experience</th>

				<th>Juvenile Football Season Opener</th>

				<th>The 2014 Opening Mass</th>

				<th>Track Day 2014</th>

			</tr>

		</table>

		<p>Loyola's Juvenile Football Team's Season Opener:</p>

		<h3>To take that photo I used the following equipment</h3>

		<ul>

			<li>Canon T3i</li>

			<li>Canon 75-300mm Telephoto Lens</li>

		</ul>
