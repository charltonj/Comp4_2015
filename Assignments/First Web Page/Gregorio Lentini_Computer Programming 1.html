		<h2>The World of Philosophy</h2>
		
		<h3>A Background on Philosophy</h3>
		
		<p>Philosophy is a subject that has evolved
			and changed over the past two millennia.
			It is an extremely intellectually-challenging
			subject. One that not only demands wits, but also
			forces those involved to use creativity and countless
			hours of reading and innovating in order to come to
			personal conclusions on certain subjects. It
			began as the sole way of de-constructing and understanding 
			reality. Aristotle is the father of all western philosophy
			and laid the foundation for which it grew. Others
			then came along to add their own statements
			and refute those made before them. Philosophy has 
			made many advancements since the time of the Greeks, 
			but with the rise of science, it is becoming 
			disregarded in the eyes of society. People have been 
			quick to criticize and discriminate philosophy for its 
			apparent "lack of evidence" on subjects of truth even though
			science itself was first a subdivision of philosophy.</p>

		<p>However, the <em>truth</em> is: Science
			deals with <em>tangible</em> truths 
			<a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/186146/empiricism"> 
			(empiricism)</a> whereas philosophy deals with <em>untangible</em> 
			truths <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/492034/rationalism"> 
			(rationalism)</a>. There has long been 
			<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/"> 
			a debate between the two sides,</a> however it should be accepted that 
			both are necessary to achieve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"> 
			objective truth</a> as they both can derive at it in their respective 
			ways and fields. That being said, let's take a closer look 
			at philosophy itself. As philosophy is such a broad and 
			extremely complicated topic, let's take a look at the 
			basics instead of jumping into the many laws and ideas
			that surround it.</p>
		
		<h3>Subsections of Philosophy</h3>
		
		<h4>Philosophy is divided into five categories:</h4>

				(what is real, difference between the 
				mind and body, etc.).</td> 
 				<td>The study of correct, rational reasoning

 				<td>The study of morality (what humans should and
				shouldn't do, what makes something right or wrong).</td>

		<h4>Some of the Most Famous and Influential Philosophers:</h4> 
 		
		<ul> 
 			
			<li>Aristotle</li> 
 			<li>Immanuel Kant</li> 
 			<li>David Hume</li> 
			<li>Rene Descartes</li>
			<li>Friedrich Nietzsche</li>
			<li>Socrates</li>
			<li>Plato</li>
			<li>Thomas Aquinas</li>
			<li>John Locke</li>
			<li>Thomas Hobbes</li>
			<li>John Stuart Mill</li>
			
		</ul> 
		
		<p>Though many more philosophers could have been in the list above,
		those particular philosophers changed the scope of philosophy to a
		great extent and helped make it what it is today. They wrote numerous 
		books and texts to express their views while revolutionizing the way 
		people looked at the world. They created basis' from which entire 
		philosophical branches were created. For example, Descartes' <em>"I 
		think therefore I am"</em> has been the subject of multiple debates in the
		field of epistemology. Other ideas were the foundations behind great movements, 
		such as John Locke's Liberalism which was used as the concept behind 
		the United States of America's Declaration of Independence. Their ideas may have 
		been controversial, Nietzsche's <em>"God is Dead"</em> notion is a great example, 
		but they helped humanity open its mind to different views. Even though they 
		may have contradicted one another (Hume and Kant were constantly trying to prove 
		each other wrong), their deep contemplations helped develop philosophical 
		views, such as Mill with Utilitarianism and Nietzsche with Nihilism. Some 
		of the above philosophers (the Greek ones) can be found in the famous 
		image below. See how many you can find.</p>
