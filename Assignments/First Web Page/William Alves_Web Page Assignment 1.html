	<p>As you can see from the table above, <a href="http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=99420">Max Pacioretty</a> 
	  and <a href="http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=89716">P.K. Subban</a> were the <em>Canadiens</em> top scorers in the season of 2013-2014. 
	  While the two superstars
	  contributed much to the success of the <em>Canadiens</em>, <a href="http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=73254">David Desharnais</a> and 
	  <a href="http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=24720">Andrei Markov</a> managed to put up
	  some very impressive numbers playing alongside their respective
	  linemates. The rookies also contributed to the success of the <em>Canadiens</em>, 
	  with <a href="http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=116134">Brendan Gallagher</a> and <a href="http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=130582">
	  Alex Galchenyuk</a> continuing their pro development in only their
	  second NHL campaigns. Another honourable mention should be <a href="http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=72046">Carey Price</a>, without him, 
	  we wouldn't have been celebrating anything more than a mediocre season.</p>
	<h3>Five of the most relevant rule changes should be noted by fans before the season starts:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>"The trapezoidal areas behind each net in which goaltenders are allowed to 
		play the puck are to be made 4 feet (1.2 m) wider than their current width."</li>
		<li>"The width of the hashmarks outside the faceoff circles will be extended from their current 3.5 feet to five feet."</li>
		<li>"Prior to any overtime period, both teams will change ends and the ice will be dry-scraped by an ice resurfacer. 
		The league hopes that the "long line changes" 
		and the better ice surfaces will increase scoring in overtime, and thus decrease shootouts."</li>
		<li>"Coaches no longer have to submit a list of shootout participants as it begins. The coaches will be free as to who they will pick next."</li>
		<li>"Teams that ice the puck can only use one center to take the ensuring faceoff. 
		If that player attempts to get kicked out of the faceoff to buy his team time, he'll get a two-minute delay-of-game penalty."</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>With all that said, let's get the season started!</h2>
