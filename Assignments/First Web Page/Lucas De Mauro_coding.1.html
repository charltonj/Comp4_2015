	       Here's a link that explains the origin of the domestic dog</a> 

        <p> Everyone knows what a dog is. Many people describe them as man's best friend.
            In many ways, this true. Dogs are very loyal. They will always stand by your
            side. Dogs are the perfect companion. They are cute, fun, loyal and just a joy
            to be around. They will brighten the mood. Dogs are the perfect companions.
          
                                                                                  </p>
        <p> This project will help you understand different types of dogs. Different types 
        of dogs means different characteristics, different wants and needs, etc. Also, 
        different types of dogs are meant for different types of people. I will only be
        three types of dogs. The types of dog groups I will be talking about are: </p>
