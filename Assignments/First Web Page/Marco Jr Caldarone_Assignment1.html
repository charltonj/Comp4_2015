			<h3>Why Do I Feel This Way About The Days</h3>
			<p>My feelings for Mondays is an easy one. I think that it is fair to say that Monday is everyone's least favourite day of the week. If you were to ask a random stranger on the street what their least favourite day is, 9 out of 10 times they would say Monday (I have no real evidence to back this claim).
			Tuesdays aren't really any better since the weekend is long behind you and the next weekend is so far away. Wednesday is really just ok because you know that it's mid week but the weekend is still so far away.
			Thursday is next, you can practically smell the weekend. You are so excited that you can't wait any longer, but you must still remember that it is still a school day. Next we have Friday, the best day of the week (not the weekend). 
			God's gift to us, also known as Saturday is next and is by far the best day because there is no school today or tomorrow. Finally we have Sunday. At first glance Sunday seems like a great day, unitl... you realize that you have school tomorrow and you have to do all your homework.
			For that reason Sunday isn't actually all that great.
