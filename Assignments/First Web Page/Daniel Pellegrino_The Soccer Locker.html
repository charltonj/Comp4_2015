		<h4>The World Cup 2014</h4>
		<p> The highlight of the summer in the world of 
		soccer was the FIFA International World Cup. 
		Many teams battled hard and some made it father 
		than others. Although many of the teams were good,
		there was only one team that rose above others.
		This year Germany took the cup home after a long and well
		fought battle!</p>
